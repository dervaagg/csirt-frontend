This bootkit, designed for Windows, boasts APT-level capabilities, including secure boot and UAC bypass, along with the ability to disable security applications on victim systems. Despite Microsoft releasing resources in April to help identify BlackLotus infections and the NSA providing guidance in June to strengthen defenses against it, the leaked source code poses a significant risk. Alex Matrosov, CEO of firmware security company Binarly, emphasizes that the complexity of the supply chain on the Microsoft end and the reliance on syntactic fixes rather than addressing the entire class of related issues beneath the operating system are evident. The persistence of BlackLotus, even after the patching of CVE-2022-21894, underscores the potential long-term and industry-wide impact of vulnerabilities if not effectively mitigated.',

Alex Matrosov from Binarly points out that the leak exposes the effectiveness of such techniques in evading modern endpoint security solutions. Despite the patching of CVE-2022-21894 last year, BlackLotus was able to utilize the exploit due to the vulnerable binaries not being added to the UEFI revocation list. This incident highlights the enduring risks associated with patched vulnerabilities, emphasizing the importance for enterprise defenders and CISOs to recognize the ongoing dangers posed by threats operating below the operating system. Matrosov warns that this attack vector is likely to become more sophisticated and complex, requiring a proactive and comprehensive security approach.',

From early June onward, various threat actors actively disseminated this loader through deceptive phishing emails, YouTube videos, and web pages designed to mimic authentic sites. The moniker "CustomerLoader" was assigned due to its incorporation of the term "customer" in both its Command and Control (C2) communications and loading functionalities. By leveraging CustomerLoader, malicious actors can download diverse malware families, including infostealers, Remote Access Trojans (RATs), and commodity ransomware. These payloads, delivered as dotRunpeX samples, employ multiple anti-analysis techniques. The evaluation suggests a likely connection between CustomerLoader and a Loader-as-a-Service, though the specific service remains unidentified.

Uptycs analysts stumbled upon this malicious PoC during routine scans, where irregularities like unexpected network connections, unauthorized system access attempts, and unusual data transfers raised alarms in detection systems.

The code cleverly utilizes Linux namespaces, which partition kernel resources, to create the illusion of a root shell, albeit with restricted privileges within the user namespace. This tactic aims to deceive observers into believing the exploit`s authenticity, providing attackers with extended access to the compromised system. Upon initiation, the PoC establishes persistence by generating a `kworker` file and updating its path in the `/etc/bashrc` file. Furthermore, the PoC communicates with a Command and Control (C2) server, downloading and executing a Linux bash script from an external URL. This script, operating under the guise of kernel-level processes, steals sensitive data from the `/etc/passwd` file, manipulates the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` to grant unauthorized remote access, and employs curl to exfiltrate data via `transfer.sh.` The stolen information includes the username, hostname, and contents of the victim`s home directory, empowering the threat actor with remote control over the server for further manual data theft, leveraging the trust typically placed in kernel-level processes to evade detection by system administrators.',

The deployment of fake PoCs as a tactic to target both researchers and potential threat actors with malware is not a new phenomenon, as evidenced by recent campaigns impersonating cybersecurity researchers and the North Korean Lazarus hackers` 2021 use of social media to distribute fake PoCs that installed backdoors. These incidents underscore the ongoing challenges faced by the cybersecurity community in navigating the landscape of deceptive tactics employed by malicious.',

            sub_title1: '',
            paragraf1: 'Sekoia uncovered an undocumented .NET loader named CustomerLoader with the ability to fetch, decrypt, and execute subsequent payloads. From early June onward, various threat actors actively disseminated this loader through deceptive phishing emails, YouTube videos, and web pages designed to mimic authentic sites. The moniker "CustomerLoader" was assigned due to its incorporation of the term "customer" in both its Command and Control (C2) communications and loading functionalities. By leveraging CustomerLoader, malicious actors can download diverse malware families, including infostealers, Remote Access Trojans (RATs), and commodity ransomware. These payloads, delivered as dotRunpeX samples, employ multiple anti-analysis techniques. The evaluation suggests a likely connection between CustomerLoader and a Loader-as-a-Service, though the specific service remains unidentified. It is conceivable that the developer of dotRunpeX integrated CustomerLoader as a new phase preceding the execution of the dotRunpeX injector.',
            sub_title2: 'Details of subsequent payloads',
            paragraf2: 'The researchers identified over 40 known malware families distributed by CustomerLoader, encompassing info-stealers like Redline, Formbook, Vidar, Stealc, Raccoon, and Lumma, marketed as Malware-as-a-Service. Additionally, they encountered Remote Access Trojans (RATs) available on GitHub, including AsyncRAT, QuasarRAT, Remcos, njRAT, and XWorm, along with other threats such as Agent Tesla, LgoogLoader, SectopRAT, Darkcloud, and WarzoneRAT. The investigation also unveiled botnets associated with specific malware families distributed through CustomerLoader, with Redline having over 80 botnets, Quasar with 45, Vidar with 9, Remcos with 6, Stealc with 4, and Formbook with 4.',
            sub_title3: 'The bottom line',
            paragraf3: 'Although CustomerLoader may not employ advanced techniques on its own, when combined with the dotRunpeX injector, it effectively lowers the detection rate of the final payload, enabling attackers to enhance their success rate in compromising systems. The multitude and diversity of malware families loaded by CustomerLoader during the first half of June indicate a widespread threat.',
